Mistborn has 3 types of rolls: Challenges, Contests, and Conflicts.
All use a pool of d6's.

Challenges use only the basic rules.
First, narrator selects appropriate Attribute, Standing or Power.
You get as many dice as that rating.
Then add a die for every supporting trait.
Add one if you have a tool; -1 for the opposite.
Favorable conditions: +1 adverse conditions: -1
Max die pool size: 10; free nudge for each die beyond 10.
Min die pool size: 2
If die pool is smaller than that, roll 2, and outcome worsens by 1 for each die below 2 (p.144).

Once pool is formed, Narrator declares a difficulty (rating from 1-5).
1 - Simple
2 - Challenging
3 - Difficult
4 - Very Hard
5 - Nearly Impossible

"Wits 3" means a Wits roll with a Difficulty of 3.

Roll all the dice in your pool. Highest match (not counting 6's) is the result. You need to match or beat the difficulty to succeed.

6's are "nudges"
Outcomes are roll result - difficulty.

6  - Godlike
5  - Legendary
4  - Astounding
3  - Amazing
2  - Excellent
1  - Good
0  - Passable
-1 - Just shy
-2 - Unfortunate
-3 - Cringe-worthy
-4 - Horrible
-5 - Disastrous
-6 - Catastrophic

## Contests

Both characters declare actions, form pools, and roll dice as usual. Character with the highest numbered set wins the contest.
If tied, most nudges. If still tied, stalemate.

## Conflicts

Step 1: Declare actions and determine available dice
Everyone does this; Narrator for NPCs, players all for themselves.
Start with character w/ lowest Wits.
If surprised, declare actions first (declaring actions _last_ is better).
As each action is declared, Narrator decides on dice to roll, just like normal
rolls. These are now called "Action Dice", and don't yet count as a dice pool.
(p.176)
Or, you can commit to defending yourself, and get Defense Dice.

Narrator decides if each action is a Challenge (unopposed) or Contest (opposed).

Step 2: Resolve actions
Start with the character w/ the most Action Dice.
Player forms a pool selected from the available Action Dice. The rest can then
be used as Defense Dice.

Alternately, the player can declare a new action; form a new set of Action Dice and half (rounding up), then they go at the end of the round.

Or, choose not to act, and all Action Dice become Defense Dice.

You can spend 2-10 Action Dice and Defense Dice at a time.
Each use depletes the pool--e.g. if you're attacked multiple times in a round.
(You can use Action Dice to defend, if you're attacked before your turn.)
